<p>
The proposed wording is inspired by the POSIX spec which says:
</p>

<dd>The value specified by cond or mutex is invalid.</dd>
<dt>[EPERM]</dt>
<dd>The mutex was not owned by the current thread at the time of the call.</dd>

<p>
I do not believe [EINVAL] is possible without memory corruption (which we don't
specify).  [EPERM] is possible if this thread doesn't own the mutex, which is
listed as a precondition.  "May" is used instead of "Shall" because not all
OS's are POSIX.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
</p>

<p>This proposal is meant to resolve potential regression of the
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2800.pdf">N2800</a>
draft, see
next section, and to relax the requirements for containers of types with
throwing move constructors.</p>

<p>The basic problem is that some containers operations, like <tt>push_back</tt>,
have a strong exception safety
guarantee (i.e. no side effects upon exception) that are not achievable when
throwing move constructors are used since there is no way to guarantee revert
after partial move. For such operations the implementation can at most provide
the basic guarantee (i.e. valid but unpredictable) as it does with multi
copying operations (e.g. range insert).</p>

<p>For example, <tt>vector&lt;T&gt;::push_back()</tt> (where <tt>T</tt> has a move
constructor) might resize the <tt>vector</tt> and move the objects to the new underlying
buffer. If move constructor throws it might
not be possible to recover the throwing object or to move the old objects back to
the original buffer.</p>

<p>The current draft is explicit by disallowing throwing move
for some operations (e.g. <tt>vector&lt;&gt;::reserve</tt>) and not clear about other
operations mentioned in 23.2.1 [container.requirements.general]/10
(e.g. single element <tt>insert</tt>): it guarantees strong exception
safety without explicitly disallowing a throwing move constructor.
</p>

<p>
<b>Regression</b>
</p>

<p>This section only refers to cases in which the contained object
is by itself a standard container.</p>

<p>Move constructors of standard containers are allowed to throw and therefore
existing operations are broken, compared with C++03, due to move optimization.
(In fact existing implementations like Dinkumware are actually throwing).</p>

<p>For example, <tt>vector&lt; list&lt;int&gt; &gt;::reserve</tt> yields
undefined behavior since <tt>list&lt;int&gt;</tt>'s move constructor is allowed to throw.
On the other hand, the same operation has strong exception safety guarantee in
C++03.</p>

<p>There are few options to solve this regression:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Disallow throwing move and throwing default constructor
</li>

<li>
Disallow throwing move but disallowing usage after move
</li>

<li>
Special casing
</li>

<li>
Disallow throwing move and making it optional
</li>

</ol>

<p>Option 1 is suggested by proposal
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2815.html">N2815</a>
but it might not be applicable for existing implementations for which
containers default constructors are throwing.</p>

<p>Option 2 limits the usage significantly and it's error prone
by allowing zombie objects that are nothing but destructible (e.g. no <tt>clear()</tt>
is allowed after move). It also potentially complicates the implementation by
introducing special state.</p>

<p>Option 3 is possible, for example, using default
construction and <tt>swap</tt> instead of move for standard containers case. The
implementation is also free to provide special hidden operation for non
throwing move without forcing the user the cope with the limitation of option-2
when using the public move.</p>

<p>Option 4 impact the efficiency in all use cases due to rare throwing move.</p>

<p>The proposed wording will imply option 1 or 3 though option 2 is also
achievable using more wording. I personally oppose to option 2 that has impact
on usability.</p>

<p>
<b>Relaxation for user types</b>
</p>

<p>Disallowing throwing move constructors in general seems very restrictive
since, for example, common implementation of move will be default construction
+ <tt>swap</tt> so move will throw if the
default constructor will throw. This is currently the case with the Dinkumware
implementation of node based containers (e.g. <tt>std::list</tt>)
though this section doesn't refer to standard types.</p>

<p>For throwing move constructors it seem that the implementation should have
no problems to provide the basic guarantee instead of the strong one. It's
better to allow throwing move constructors with basic guarantee than to
disallow it silently (compile and run), via undefined behavior.</p>

<p>There might still be cases in which the relaxation will break existing generic
code that assumes the strong guarantee but it's broken either way given a
throwing move constructor since this is not a preserving optimization. </p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
As specified in the latest draft,
<a 
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2914.pdf">N2914</a>,
<code>num_get</code> is still not fully compatible with the following C
functions: <code>strtoul</code>, <code>strtoull</code>, 
<code>strtof</code> and
<code>strtod</code>.
</p>
<p>
In C, when conversion of a string to an unsigned integer type falls 
outside the
representable range, <code>strtoul</code> and <code>strtoull</code> return
<code>ULONG_MAX</code> and <code>ULLONG_MAX</code>, respectively, 
regardless
whether the input field represents a positive or a negative value.
On the other hand, the result of <code>num_get</code> conversion of 
negative
values to unsigned integer types is zero. This raises a compatibility 
issue.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, in C, when conversion of a string to a floating-point type falls
outside the representable range, <code>strtof</code>, <code>strtod</code> 
and
<code>strtold</code> return <code>&#xB1HUGE_VALF</code>,
<code>&#xB1HUGE_VAL</code> and <code>&#xB1HUGE_VALL</code>, respectively.
On the other hand, the result of <code>num_get</code> conversion of such
out-of-range floating-point values results in the most positive/negative
representable value.
Although many C library implementations do implement <code>HUGE_VAL</code>
(etc.) as the highest representable (which is, usually, the infinity), 
this isn't required by the C standard. The C library specification makes no
statement regarding the value of <code>HUGE_VAL</code> and friends, which
potentially raises the same compatibility issue as in the above case of
unsigned integers.
In addition, neither C nor C++ define symbolic constants for the maximum
representable floating-point values (they only do so only for the maximum
representable <i>finite</i> floating-point values), which raises a 
usability
issue (it would be hard for the programmer to check the result of
<code>num_get</code> against overflow).
</p>
<p>
As such, we propose to adjust the specification of <code>num_get</code> to
closely follow the behavior of all of its underlying C functions.

<p>
When I look at the <tt>unordered_*</tt> constructors, I think the complexity is poorly
described and does not follow the style of the rest of the standard.
</p>

<p>
The complexity for the default constructor is specified as constant.
Actually, it is proportional to <tt>n</tt>, but there are no invocations of
<tt>value_type</tt> constructors or other <tt>value_type</tt> operations.
</p>

<p>
For the iterator-based constructor the complexity should be:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Complexity:</i> exactly <tt>n</tt> calls to construct <tt>value_type</tt>
from <tt>InputIterator::value_type</tt> (where <tt>n = distance(f,l)</tt>).
The number of calls to <tt>key_equal::operator()</tt> is proportional to
<tt>n</tt> in the average case and <tt>n*n</tt> in the worst case.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
Concern that the current wording may require O(1) where that cannot be delivered.  We need to look at

<h3><a name="1213"></a>1213. Meaning of valid and singular iterator underspecified</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The terms <em>valid</em> iterator and <em>singular</em> aren't
properly defined. The fuzziness of those terms became even worse
after the resolution of <a href="lwg-defects.html#208">208</a> (including further updates by <a href="lwg-defects.html#278">278</a>). In
24.2 [iterator.requirements] as of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2723.pdf">N2723</a>
the standard says now:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
5 - These values are called past-the-end values. Values of an iterator <tt>i</tt> for
which the expression <tt>*i</tt> is defined are called dereferenceable. The library
never assumes that past-the-end values are dereferenceable. Iterators
can also have singular values that are not associated with any
container. [...] Results of most expressions are undefined for singular
values; the only exceptions are destroying an iterator that holds a
singular value and the assignment of a non-singular value to an iterator
that holds a singular value. [...] Dereferenceable values are always
non-singular.
</p>

<p>
10 - An invalid iterator is an iterator that may be singular.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
First, issue <a href="lwg-defects.html#208">208</a> intentionally removed the earlier constraint that past-the-end
values are always non-singular. The reason for this was to support null
pointers as past-the-end iterators of e.g. empty sequences. But there
seem to exist different views on what a singular (iterator) value is. E.g.
according to the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/trivial.html">SGI definition</a>
a null pointer is <em>not</em> a singular value:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dereferenceable iterators are always nonsingular, but the converse is
not true.
For example, a null pointer is nonsingular (there are well defined operations
involving null pointers) even thought it is not dereferenceable.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
and <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/InputIterator.html">proceeds</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
An iterator is valid if it is dereferenceable or past-the-end.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Even if the standard prefers a different meaning of singular here, the
change was incomplete, because by restricting feasible expressions of singular
iterators to destruction and assignment isn't sufficient for a past-the-end
iterator: Of-course it must still be equality-comparable and in general be a readable value.
</p>

<p>
Second, the standard doesn't clearly say whether a past-the-end value is
a valid iterator or not. E.g. 20.9.8 [specialized.algorithms]/1 says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
In all of the following algorithms, the formal template parameter <tt>ForwardIterator</tt> 
is required to satisfy the requirements of a forward iterator (24.1.3)
[..], and is required to have the property that no exceptions are thrown from [..], or
dereference of valid iterators.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The standard should make better clear what "singular pointer" and "valid
iterator" means. The fact that the meaning of a valid <em>value</em>
has a core language meaning doesn't imply that for an iterator concept
the term "valid iterator" has the same meaning.
</p>

<p>
Let me add a final example: In X [allocator.concepts.members] of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2914.pdf">N2914</a>
we find:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
pointer X::allocate(size_type n);
</pre>

<blockquote><p>
11 <i>Returns:</i> a pointer to the allocated memory. [<i>Note:</i> if <tt>n == 0</tt>, the return
value is unspecified. &mdash;<i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
[..]
</p>

<pre>
void X::deallocate(pointer p, size_type n);
</pre>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Preconditions:</i> <tt>p</tt> shall be a non-singular pointer value obtained from a call
to <tt>allocate()</tt> on this allocator or one that compares equal to it.
</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
If singular pointer value would include null pointers this make the
preconditions
unclear if the pointer value is a result of <tt>allocate(0)</tt>: Since the return value
is unspecified, it could be a null pointer. Does that mean that programmers
need to check the pointer value for a null value before calling deallocate?

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Scott Meyers' mentions on a recent posting on <a
href="http://groups.google.de/group/comp.std.c++/msg/6f9160fc428bcbea">c.s.c++</a>
some arguments that point to an incomplete resolution
of <a href="lwg-defects.html#103">103</a> and to an inconsistency of requirements on keys in ordered and
unordered associative
containers:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
1) <a href="lwg-defects.html#103">103</a> introduced the term immutable without defining it in a unique manner in
23.2.4 [associative.reqmts]/5:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
[..] Keys in an associative container are immutable.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
According to conventional dictionaries immutable is an unconditional way of
saying that something cannot be changed. So without any further explicit
allowance a user <em>always</em> runs into undefined behavior if (s)he attempts
to modify such a key. IMO this was not the intend of the committee to resolve
<a href="lwg-defects.html#103">103</a> in that way because the comments suggest an interpretation that
should give any user the freedom to modify the key in an <em>explicit</em> way
<em>provided</em> it would not affect the sort order in that container.
</p>

<p>
2) Another observation was that surprisingly no similar 'safety guards'
exists against unintentional key changes for the unordered associative
containers, specifically there is no such requirement as in
23.2.4 [associative.reqmts]/6 that "both <tt>iterator</tt> and <tt>const_iterator</tt> are constant
iterators". But the need for such protection against unintentional
changes as well as the constraints in which manner any explicit
changes may be performed are both missing and necessary, because
such changes could potentially change the <em>equivalence</em> of keys that
is measured by the <tt>hasher</tt> and <tt>key_equal</tt>.
</p>

<p>
I suggest to fix the unconditional wording involved with "immutable keys"
by at least adding a hint for the reader that users <em>may</em> perform such
changes in an explicit manner <em>and</em> to perform similar wording changes
as <a href="lwg-defects.html#103">103</a> did for the ordered associative containers also for the unordered
containers.

</li>

<li>
<p>
Change 23.2.5 [unord.req]/3+4 as indicated: <i>[The current sentence of

of this issue, but is recommended to better clarify the nomenclature and the
difference between the function objects and the function object <em>types</em>,
which is important, because both can potentially be stateful.]</i>
</p>

<blockquote>

3 Each unordered associative container is parameterized by <tt>Key</tt>, by a

<li>
<p>
After 23.2.5 [unord.req]/7 add the following new paragraph: <i>[This
ensures the same level of compile-time protection that we already require for

<h3><a name="1297"></a>1297. <tt>unique_ptr</tt>'s relational operator functions should induce a total order</h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
The comparison functions of <tt>unique_ptr</tt> currently directly delegate to
the underlying comparison functions of <tt>unique_ptr&lt;T, D&gt;::pointer</tt>.
This is disadvantageous, because this would not guarantee to induce a total
ordering for native pointers and it is hard to define a total order for mixed
types anyway.
</p>
<p>
The currently suggested resolution for <tt>shared_ptr</tt> comparison as of
<a href="lwg-defects.html#1262">1262</a> uses a normalization strategy: They perform the comparison on
the <em>composite pointer type</em> (5.9 [expr.rel]). This is not
exactly possible for <tt>unique_ptr</tt> in the presence of user-defined
pointer-like types but the existing definition of <tt>std::duration</tt>
comparison as of 20.11.3.6 [time.duration.comparisons] via
<tt>common_type</tt> of both argument types demonstrates a solution of this
problem. The approach can be seen as the general way to define a <em>composite
pointer type</em> and this is the approach which is used for here suggested
wording change.
</p>
<p>
For consistency reasons I would have preferred the same normalization strategy
for <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt>, but Howard convinced me not to do so (now).

says that containers should have a nested typedef that defines their
<tt>reference_type</tt> as <tt>value_type&amp;</tt>; the previous
standard deferred to the allocator to define its
<tt>reference_type</tt>, and containers simply passed the allocator's
typedef on. This change is a mistake. Allocators should define both a
<tt>pointer</tt> type and a <tt>reference</tt> type. That's essential
for their original purpose, which was to make different memory models
transparent. If an allocator defines a <tt>pointer</tt> type that isn't
compatible with a normal pointer it also has to define a corresponding
<tt>reference</tt> type. For example (and please forgive a Windows-ism),
if an allocator's pointer is <tt>T __far*</tt>, then it's
<tt>reference</tt> has to be <tt>T __far&amp;</tt>. Otherwise everything
crashes (under the hood, references are pointers and have to have the
same memory access mechanics). Extensions such as this for more general
memory models were explicitly encouraged by C++03, and the allocator's
<tt>pointer</tt> and <tt>reference</tt> typedefs were the hooks for such
extensions. Removing the allocator's <tt>reference</tt> and
<tt>const_reference</tt> typedefs makes those extensions unimplementable

<p><i>[

<p>
Unfortunately, the current P/R is defective for several reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Table 43 &mdash; Descriptive variable definitions still contains three
references to <tt>T&amp;</tt>, namely in:
<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>
<tt>t</tt>
</td>
<td>a value of type <tt>const T&amp;</tt></td>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>s</tt>
</td>
<td>a value of type <tt>const T&amp;</tt> obtained by the expression <tt>*q</tt>
or by conversion from a value <tt>r</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
Especially the second and third items are misses in the 1318 P/R,
e.g. in N2723 or in C++03 these were referring
to <tt>X::reference</tt> and <tt>X::const_reference</tt>, resp.
None of them is referenced anywhere in the allocator requirements
table: <tt>r</tt> and <tt>s</tt> where historically needed to
define the expressions <tt>a.address(r)</tt> and <tt>a.address(s)</tt> which are gone now,
and <tt>t</tt> was needed to define the expression <tt>a.construct(p, t)</tt> which has been
replaced by <tt>a.construct(p,args)</tt>.
<p/>
The easiest fix seems to be to remove all three rows from Table 43.
</li>
<li>
Further-on, the current P/R suggests to replace the the current
definitions of the adaptor classes
<blockquote><pre>
stack
priority_queue
queue
</pre></blockquote>
similar to the other container types, i.e. to define <tt>reference</tt> and
<tt>const_reference</tt> now as
<blockquote><pre>
typedef typename allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::reference reference;
typedef typename allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::const_reference const_reference;
</pre></blockquote>
This would not only be an ill-formed definition (because there is no name
<tt>Allocator</tt> in scope), but it would also introduce a breakage compared to C++03,
where these definitions where already referring to the definition of the wrapped 
containers. So, the adaptor class templates should be removed from the current list.
</li>
<li>
Then the current P/R wording leads to one further unexpected and unwanted change due to 
the general formular used: <tt>match_result::reference</tt> is currently defined as
<blockquote><pre>
typedef const_reference reference;
</pre></blockquote>
because it is an <em>immutable</em> container (And we had this definition
already in N2723). The application of the rule would change this silently.
</li>
<li>
Finally the suggested wording for the <tt>unordered_</tt> containers is incomplete.
The reason is a current inconsistency between these containers and the rest: While
normally the definition of the pointer types is
<blockquote><pre>
typedef typename allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::pointer pointer;
typedef typename allocator_traits&lt;Allocator&gt;::const_pointer const_pointer;
</pre></blockquote>
for the unordered containers they are
<blockquote><pre>
typedef typename allocator_type::pointer pointer;
typedef typename allocator_type::const_pointer const_pointer;
</pre></blockquote>
These definitions are <em>not</em> equivalent, because allocators are no longer
required to define typedefs <tt>pointer</tt> and <tt>const_pointer</tt>, the
<tt>allocator_traits</tt> were invented as a further indirection to cope
with that. I.e. for the unordered containers we need to bring both the definition
of references <em>and</em> pointers in sync.
</li>
</ol>

<p><i>[
2011-02-23 Daniel updates the proposed wording with support from Pablo

<p>The update attempts to fix the backward-compatibility problem that we have
introduced by ignoring the C++03 member function overloads <tt>address</tt>
of allocator types in C++0x completely. The resolution attempts to fix that
by adding these functions as optional members of allocators that are considered
first before falling back to <tt>pointer_traits::pointer_to</tt>. This still
allows us to remove the unused symbol <tt>t</tt> from the table, but we adapt
the symbols <tt>r</tt> and <tt>s</tt> to purely refer to the typenames
<tt>reference</tt> and <tt>const_reference</tt>.</p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Abstract:
</p>
<p>
In general, it seems that in a couple of places container behavior is
not described in requirement tables although it is a general behavior.
</p>

<p>
History:
</p>

<p>
Issue <a href="lwg-defects.html#676">676</a> added move semantics to unordered containers.
For the added insert functions the Editor requested to put their
semantic description into a requirements table rather than describing
them for each container individually. The text however was taken from
the associative containers, where we also have the semantics for each
container described. Also, <a href="lwg-defects.html#1034">1034</a> is to some extend
requesting a clarification of the requirement tables and it turned out
that in other places we have the same problem (e.g. we have no general
requirement for type pointer and const_pointer although each container
has them with issue <a href="lwg-defects.html#1306">1306</a>).
</p>

<p>
From my personal list of functions in requirement tables
and containers, the following types/functions are missing in
requirement tables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>pointer</tt>, <tt>const_pointer</tt> in Table 91 (container requirements)
</li>
<li>
<p>
all copy constructors, copy constructors with allocator,
 assignment operators, and insert operators
 with move semantics for associative and unordered containers
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
ContType c1(c2&amp;&amp;)
ContType c1(c2&amp;&amp;,alloc)
c1 = c2&amp;&amp;
c.insert(val&amp;&amp;)
c.insert(pos,val&amp;&amp;)
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a special case, we lack the following requirements for all sequence
containers BUT array (so special wording or a new container category is
required):
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
constructor with only a size argument
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
ContType c(num)
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>
copy constructor with allocator and move semantics
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
ContType c1(c2&amp;&amp;,alloc)
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>
all constructors that insert multiple elements with additional allocator
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
ContType c(num, val,alloc)
ContType c(beg, end,alloc)
ContType c(initlist,alloc)
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>
all resize functiuons:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
c.resize(num)
c.resize(num,val)
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that we also might have to add additional requirements on other
places for sequence containers because having an allocator requires
additional statements for the treatment of the allocators. E.g. swap for
containers with allocators is not specified in any requirement table.
</p>

<p>
And finally, if we have the requirements in the requirements tables, we
can remove the corresponding descriptions for the individual container.
However, note that sequence container requirements have NO complexity
column, so that we still need container specific descriptions for the
functions listed there.
</p>

<p><i>[
2010 Batavia
]</i></p>

<p>
While there is consensus that further cleaning up the container requirement
tables would be a good thing, there is no feeling that this <em>must</em>
be done in time for 0x.  The issue remains open, but Deferred.

<p>
All library types should have non-throwing move
constructors and move-assignment operators unless
wrapping a type with a potentially throwing move operation.
When such a type is a class-template, these
operations should have a conditional <tt>noexcept</tt>
specification.
</p>
<p>
There are many other places where a <tt>noexcept</tt>
specification may be considered, but the move operations
are a special case that must be called out, to effectively
support the <tt>move_if_noexcept</tt> function template.
</p>

<p><i>[
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:

<p>
Review every class and class template in the library. If <tt>noexcept</tt> 
move constructor/assignment operators can be implicitly declared, then they
should be implicitly declared, or explicitly defaulted. Otherwise, a move 
constructor/move assignment operator with a <tt>noexcept</tt> exception
specification should be provided.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p><b>Addresses GB-64</b></p>
<p>
There are a number of unspecified types used throughout
the library, such as the container iterators. Many of these
unspecified types have restrictions or expectations on
their behaviour in terms of exceptions. Are they permitted
or required to use exception specifications, more
specifically the new <tt>noexcept</tt> specification? For example,
if <tt>vector&lt;T>::iterator</tt> is implemented as a native pointer,
all its operations will have an (effective) <tt>noexcept</tt>
specification. If the implementation uses a class type to
implement this iterator, is it permitted or required to
support that same guarantee?
</p>

<p><i>[
Resolution proposed by ballot comment
]</i></p>

<p>
Clearly state the requirements for exception
specifications on all unspecified library types. For
example, all container iterator operations should
be conditionally <tt>noexcept</tt>, with the condition
matching the same operation applied to the
allocator's <tt>pointer_type</tt>, a certain subset of which
are already required not to throw.

Nothrowing <tt>swap</tt> operations are key to many C++ idioms,
notably the common copy/swap idiom to provide the
strong exception safety guarantee.
</p>

<p><i>[

<p>
Where possible, all library types should provide a
<tt>swap</tt> operation with an exception specification
guaranteeing no exception shall propagate.
Where <tt>noexcept(true)</tt> cannot be guaranteed to
not terminate the program, and the <tt>swap</tt> in
questions is a template, an exception specification
with the appropriate conditional expression could
be specified.

<p>
The general approach on moving is that a library object
after moving out is in a "valid but unspecified state". But
this is stated at the single object specifications, which is
error prone (especially if the move operations are implicit)
and unnecessary duplication.

<p>
Consider putting a general statement to the same
effect into clause 17.

The <tt>&lt;thread></tt> header uses <tt>duration</tt> types, found in the
<tt>&lt;chrono></tt> header, and which rely on the <tt>ratio</tt> types
declared in the <tt>&lt;ratio></tt> header.
</p>

<p><i>[
Extracts from lengthy Rapperswil discussion:
]</i></p>

<p>
There is a concern that this issue is a misunderstanding of the actual
requirements of a free-standing implementation to support the <tt>&lt;thread></tt>
header.  In general, a free-standanding implementation will provide an <em>empty</em>
header, specifically so that a user can test for the absence of the 
<tt>_ _ STDCPP_THREADS _ _</tt> macro.  This idiom as used as there is no portable way to test for the lack of a header.
</p>
<p>
At this point, it was suggested the NB comment is trying to solve the wrong problem, and that <tt>_ _ STDCPP_THREADS _ _</tt> should be a pre-defined macro in clause 16 that can be tested before including <tt>&lt;thread></tt>.  That would remove the need to add additional headers to the free-standanding requirements.
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting that Japan requested <tt>&lt;ratio></tt> as a free-standing header in their CD1 comments.  No-one seemed keen to require clocks of a free-standing implementation though.

<p>
One idea for the <tt>exception_ptr</tt> type was that a reference-counted
implementation could simply 'reactivate' the same
exception object in the context of a call to
<tt>rethrow_exception</tt>. Such an implementation would allow
the same exception object to be active in multiple threads
(such as when multiple threads join on a <tt>shared_future</tt>)
and introduce potential data races in any exception
handler that catches exceptions by reference - notably
existing library code written before this capability was
added. <tt>rethrow_exception</tt> should <em>always</em> make a copy
of the target exception object.
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>

<blockquote><p><ins>
<i>Throws</i>: a copy of the exception object to which <tt>p</tt> refers.

<p><b>Addresses US-85</b></p>
<p>
20.2.1 Table 34 "MoveConstructible requirements" says
"Note: rv remains a valid object. Its state is unspecified".
Some components give stronger guarantees. For
example, moved-from <tt>shared_ptr</tt>s are guaranteed <tt>empty</tt>
(20.9.11.2.1/25).
In general, what the standard really should say (preferably
as a global blanket statement) is that moved-from objects
can be destroyed and can be the destination of an
assignment. Anything else is radioactive. For example,
containers can be "emptier than empty". This needs to be
explicit and required generally.
</p>
<p>
Note: The last time that one of us mentioned "emptier
than empty" (i.e. containers missing sentinel nodes, etc.)
the objection was that containers can store sentinel nodes
inside themselves in order to avoid dynamically allocating
them. This is unacceptable because
</p>
<p>
(a) it forces existing implementations (i.e. Dinkumware's, Microsoft's,
IBM's,  etc.) to change for no good reason (i.e. permitting more
operations on moved-from objects), and 
</p>
<p>
(b) it invalidates end-iterators when swapping containers. (The Working
Paper currently permits end-iterator invalidation, which we
consider to be wrong, but that's a separate argument. In
any event, <em>mandating</em> end-iterator invalidation is very
different from permitting it.)
</p>

<p><i>[
Resolution proposed in ballot comment

<p>
State as a general requirement that moved-from
objects can be destroyed and can be the
destination of an assignment. Any other use is
undefined behavior.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p><b>Addresses GB-124</b></p>

<p>
N3092 27.8.1.3 [stringbuf.members] contains this text specifying the postconditions of
<tt>basic_stringbuf::str(basic_string)</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Postconditions: If <tt>mode &amp; ios_base::out</tt> is <tt>true</tt>,
<tt>pbase()</tt> points to the first underlying character and <tt>epptr() >=
pbase() + s.size()</tt> holds; in addition, if <tt>mode &amp; ios_base::in</tt>
is <tt>true</tt>, <tt>pptr() == pbase() + s.data()</tt> holds, otherwise
<tt>pptr() == pbase()</tt> is <tt>true</tt>. [...]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Firstly, there's a simple mistake: It should be <tt>pbase() + s.length()</tt>,
not <tt>pbase() + s.data()</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, it doesn't match existing implementations. As far as I can tell,
GCC 4.5 does not test for <tt>mode &amp; ios_base::in</tt> in the second part
of that sentence, but for <tt>mode &amp; (ios_base::app | ios_base_ate)</tt>,
and Visual C++ 9 for <tt>mode &amp; ios_base::app</tt>. Besides, the wording of
the C++0x draft doesn't make any sense to me. I suggest changing the second part
of the sentence to one of the following:
</p>
<p>
Replace <tt>ios_base::in</tt> with <tt>(ios_base::ate | ios_base::app)</tt>,
but this would require Visual C++ to change (replacing only with
<tt>ios_base::ate</tt> would require GCC to change, and would make
<tt>ios_base::app</tt> completely useless with <tt>stringstreams</tt>):
</p>
<p>
in addition, if <tt>mode &amp; (ios_base::ate | ios_base::app)</tt> is <tt>true</tt>,
<tt>pptr() == pbase() + s.length()</tt> holds, otherwise <tt>pptr() == pbase()</tt>
is <tt>true</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Leave <tt>pptr()</tt> unspecified if <tt>mode &amp; ios_base::app</tt>, but not
<tt>mode &amp; ios_base::ate</tt> (implementations already differ in this case, and it
is always possible to use <tt>ios_base::ate</tt> to get the effect of appending, so it
is not necessary to require any implementation to change):
</p>
<p>
in addition, if <tt>mode &amp; ios_base::ate</tt> is <tt>true</tt>,
<tt>pptr() == pbase() + s.length()</tt> holds, if neither <tt>mode &amp; ios_base::ate</tt>
nor <tt>mode &amp; ios_base::app</tt> is <tt>true</tt>, <tt>pptr() == pbase()</tt> holds,
otherwise <tt>pptr() >= pbase() &amp;&amp; pptr() &lt;= pbase() + s.length()</tt>
(which of the values in this range is unspecified).
</p>
<p>
Slightly stricter:
</p>
<p>
in addition, if <tt>mode &amp; ios_base::ate</tt> is <tt>true</tt>,
<tt>pptr() == pbase() + s.length()</tt> holds, if neither
<tt>mode &amp; ios_base::ate</tt> nor <tt>mode &amp; ios_base::app</tt> is <tt>true</tt>,
<tt>pptr() == pbase()</tt> holds, otherwise <tt>pptr() == pbase() || pptr() == pbase() + s.length()</tt>
(which of these two values is unspecified). A small table might help to better explain the three cases.
BTW, at the end of the postconditions is this text: &quot;<tt>egptr() == eback() + s.size()</tt> hold&quot;.
Is there a perference for <tt>basic_string::length</tt> or <tt>basic_string::size</tt>? It doesn't really
matter, but it looks a bit inconsistent.

<p>
The Bitmask Type requirements in 17.5.2.1.3 [bitmask.types] p.3 say that
all elements on a bitmask type have distinct values, but
28.5.2 [re.matchflag] defines <tt>regex_constants::match_default</tt> and
<tt>regex_constants::format_default</tt> as elements of the
bitmask type <tt>regex_constants::match_flag_type</tt>, both with
value 0. This is a contradiction.
</p>

<p><i>[
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:

<blockquote><p>
One of the bitmask elements should be removed
from the declaration and should be defined
separately, in the same manner as
<tt>ios_base::adjustfield</tt>, <tt>ios_base::basefield</tt> and
<tt>ios_base::floatfield</tt> are defined by 27.5.2.1.2 [ios::fmtflags] p.2
and Table 120. These are constants of a bitmask
type, but are not distinct elements, they have
more than one value set in the bitmask.
<tt>regex_constants::format_default</tt> should be
specified as a constant with the same value as
<tt>regex_constants::match_default</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>[
2010-10-31 Daniel comments:

<p>
Strictly speaking, a bitmask type cannot have any element of value 0 at all, because
any such value would contradict the requirement expressed in 17.5.2.1.3 [bitmask.types] p. 3:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
for any pair <em>Ci</em> and <em>Cj</em>, <em>Ci</em> &amp; <em>Ci</em> is nonzero
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So, actually <em>both</em> <tt>regex_constants::match_default</tt> and

29.4 [atomics.lockfree] p.8 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
An atomic store shall only store a value that has
been computed from constants and program input values
by a finite sequence of program evaluations, such
that each evaluation observes the values of variables
as computed by the last prior assignment in the
sequence.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
... but 1.9 [intro.execution] p.13 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If A is not sequenced before B and B is not
sequenced before A, then A and B are unsequenced.
[ <em>Note</em>: The execution of unsequenced
evaluations can overlap. &mdash; <em>end note</em> ]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Overlapping executions can make it impossible to
construct the sequence described in 29.4 [atomics.lockfree] p.8. We are not
sure of the intention here and do not offer a suggestion for
change, but note that 29.4 [atomics.lockfree] p.8 is the condition that prevents
out-of-thin-air reads.
</p>
<p>
For an example, suppose we have a function invocation
f(e1,e2). The evaluations of e1 and e2 can overlap.
Suppose that the evaluation of e1 writes y and reads x
whereas the evaluation of e2 reads y and writes x, with
reads-from edges as below (all this is within a single
thread).
</p>
<pre>
 e1           e2
Wrlx y--   --Wrlx x
      rf\ /rf
         X
        / \
Rrlx x&lt;-   -&gt;Rrlx y
</pre>
<p>
This seems like it should be allowed, but there seems to
be no way to produce a sequence of evaluations with the
property above.
</p>
<p>
In more detail, here the two evaluations, e1 and e2, are
being executed as the arguments of a function and are
consequently not sequenced-before each other. In
practice we'd expect that they could overlap (as allowed
by 1.9 [intro.execution] p.13), with the two writes taking effect before the two
reads. However, if we have to construct a linear order of
evaluations, as in 29.4 [atomics.lockfree] p.8, then the execution above is not
permited. Is that really intended?

We believe the intent is that for any atomics there is a distinguished

other operations on that atomic - specifically so that the
initialisation write might be non-atomic and hence give rise to a data
race, and hence undefined behaviour, in examples such as this (from
Hans):

<ol>
<li>
<p>Change the Operational semantics of <tt>C1::now()</tt> in 20.11.1 [time.clock.req],

</li>
</ol>

<p><i>[2011-02-19: Daniel comments and suggests an alternative wording]</i></p>


<p>Imposing the no-throw requirement on <tt>C1::now()</tt> of any clock time
is an overly radical step: It has the indirect consequences that representation
types for <tt>C1::rep</tt> can never by types with dynamic memory managment,
e.g. my <tt>big_int</tt>, which are currently fully supported by the time
utilities. Further-on this strong constraint does not even solve the problem
described in the issue, because we are still left with the fact that any
of the arithmetic operations of <tt>C1::rep</tt>, <tt>C1::duration</tt>,
and <tt>C1::time_point</tt> may throw exceptions.
</p>
<p>The alternative proposal uses the following strategy: The general <tt>Clock</tt>
requirements remain untouched, but we require that any functions of the library-provided
clocks from sub-clause 20.11.5 [time.clock] and their associated types shall not
throw exceptions. Second, we replace existing <tt>noexcept</tt> specifications of
functions from Clause 30 that depend on durations, clocks, or time points by wording that
clarifies that these functions can only throw, if the operations of user-provided durations,
clocks, or time points used as arguments to these functions throw exceptions.

<p>
The standard doesn't say that containers should use abstract pointer 
types internally. Both Howard and Pablo agree that this is the intent. 
Further, it is necessary for containers to be stored, for example, in 
shared memory with an interprocess allocator (the type of scenario that 
allocators are intended to support).
</p>
<p>
In spite of the (possible) agreement on intent, it is necessary to make 
this explicit:
</p>
<p>
An implementations may like to store the result of dereferencing the 
pointer (which is a raw reference) as an optimization, but that prevents 
the data structure from being put in shared memory, etc. In fact, a 
container could store raw references to the allocator, which would be a 
little weird but conforming as long as it has one by-value copy. 
Furthermore, pointers to locales, ctypes, etc. may be there, which also 
prevents the data structure from being put in shared memory, so we 
should make explicit that a container does not store raw pointers or 
references at all.

<p>Clause 29 does not specify noexcept for any of the atomic operations.
It probably should, though that's not completely clear.
In particular, atomics may want to throw in implementations that support transactional memory.

<p><i>[

<p>
I believe both paragraphs need more cleanup: First, the current Requires element conflict with the Remark; 
second, it seems to me that the whole single Requires element is intended to be split into a Requires
and an Effects element; third, the reference to <tt>tuple</tt> is incorrect (noticed by Paolo Carlini);
fourth, it refers to some non-existing <tt>InputIterator</tt> parameter relevant for a completely different
overload; sixth, the return type of the overload with hint is wrong.
The following proposed resolution tries to solve these issues as well and uses similar wording as for
the corresponding unordered containers. Unfortunately it has some redundancy over Table&nbsp;99, but I did
not remove the specification because of the more general template parameter <tt>P</tt> - the Table&nbsp;99 
requirements apply only for an argument <em>identical</em> to <tt>value_type</tt>.

<p>
The Throws clause for <tt>packaged_task::operator()</tt> says that it throws "a
<tt>future_error</tt> exception object if there is no associated asynchronous
state or the stored task has already been invoked." However, the Error
Conditions clause does not define an error condition when the stored task has
already been invoked, only when the associated state is already ready (i.e. the
invocation has completed).

<p>
The functions (<tt>w</tt>)<tt>stoi</tt> and (<tt>w</tt>)<tt>stof</tt>
are specified in terms of calling C library APIs for potentially wider
types.  The integer and floating-point versions have subtly different
behaviour when reading values that are too large to convert.  The
floating point case will throw <tt>out_of_bound</tt> if the read value
is too large to convert to the wider type used in the implementation,
but behaviour is undefined if the converted value cannot narrow to a
float.  The integer case will throw <tt>out_of_bounds</tt> if the
converted value cannot be represented in the narrower type, but throws
<tt>invalid_argument</tt>, rather than <tt>out_of_bounds</tt>, if the
conversion to the wider type fails due to overflow.
</p>

<p>
Suggest that the Throws clause for both specifications should be
consistent, supporting the same set of fail-modes with the matching set
of exceptions.

20.8.10.1.1 [func.bind.isbind] says for <tt>is_bind_expression</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Users may specialize this template to indicate that a type should be
treated as a subexpression in a <tt>bind</tt> call.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
But it also says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
If <tt>T</tt> is a type returned from <tt>bind</tt>,
<tt>is_bind_expression&lt;T&gt;</tt> shall be publicly derived from

<p>
This means that while the user is free to specialize, any specialization

<p>
Although it's not 100% clear what "the sequence after stage 2" should mean here,
when there is no stage 2, the only reasonable assumption is that it is the
contents of the string being output.  In the above code, the string being output
is "<tt>0X1Y2Z</tt>", which starts with "<tt>0X</tt>", so the padding should be
inserted "after x or X", and not before the string. I believe that this is a
defect in the standard, and not in the three compilers I tried.

they both talk about <tt>tuple&lt;const key_type, mapped_type&gt;</tt> but I think they

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>Suppose that a particular function is not tagged as constexpr in the standard,
but that, in some particular implementation, it is possible to write it within
the constexpr constraints. If an implementer tags such a function as constexpr,
is that a violation of the standard or is it a conforming extension?</p>

<p>There are two questions to consider. First, is this allowed under the
as-if rule? Second, if it does not fall under as-if, is there
(and should there be) any special license granted to implementers
to do this anyway, sort of the way we allow elision of copy constructors
even though it is detectable by users?</p>

<p>I believe that this does not fall under "as-if", so implementers
probably don't have that freedom today. I suggest changing the WP
to grant it. Even if we decide otherwise, however, I suggest that
we make it explicit.</p>



<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p><i>In 17.6.4.6 [constexpr.functions], change paragraph 1 to:</i></p>

<blockquote><p>
<ins>This standard explicitly requires that certain standard library functions
are <tt>constexpr</tt> [dcl.constexpr].
Additionally, an implementation may declare any function to be <tt>constexpr</tt>
if that function's definition satisfies the necessary constraints.</ins>
Within any header that provides any non-defining declarations of <tt>constexpr</tt>
functions or constructors an implementation shall provide corresponding definitions.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>According to N3126&nbsp;&#x2011;&nbsp;3.9/9,</p>

<p>&quot;Scalar types, trivial class types (Clause 9), arrays of such types
and <i>cv</i>&#x2011;qualified versions of these types (3.9.3) are collectively
called <i>trivial types</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus, an array (possibly of unknown bound) can be trivial type, non&#x2011;trivial type, 
or an array type whose triviality cannot be determined because its element type is incomplete.</p>

<p>According to N3126&nbsp;&#x2011;&nbsp;Table 45, preconditions for <tt>std::is_trivial</tt> are
defined as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;<tt>T</tt> shall be a complete type, (possibly <i>cv</i>-qualified) <tt>void</tt>, 
or an array of unknown bound&quot;</p>

<p>It seems that &quot;an array of unknown bound&quot; should be changed to &quot;an
array of unknown bound of a complete element type&quot;. Preconditions for
some other templates (e.g., <tt>std::is_trivially_copyable</tt>,
<tt>std::is_standard_layout</tt>, <tt>std::is_pod</tt>, and <tt>std::is_literal_type</tt>) should
be changed similarly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some preconditions look too restrictive. For
example, <tt>std::is_empty</tt> and <tt>std::is_polymorphic</tt> might accept any
incomplete non&#x2011;class type.</p>

<p><i>[2011-02-18: Daniel provides wording proposal]</i></p>


<p>
While reviewing the individual preconditions I could find three different groups of
either too weakening or too strengthening constraints:
</p>
<ol>
<li><pre>is_empty/is_polymorphic/is_abstract/has_virtual_destructor:</pre>

<p>These traits can only apply for <em>non&#x2011;union class types</em>, otherwise the result must
always be false</p>
</li>

<li><pre>is_base_of:</pre>

<p>Similar to the previous bullet, but the current wording comes already near to that ideal,
it only misses to add the <em>non&#x2011;union</em> aspect.</p>
</li>

<li><pre>is_trivial/is_trivially_copyable/is_standard_layout/is_pod/is_literal_type:</pre>

<p>These traits always require that <tt>std::remove_all_extents&lt;T&gt;::type</tt> to be <tt><i>cv</i> void</tt> or 
a complete type.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="2016"></a>2016. <tt>Allocators</tt> must be no-throw <i>swappable</i></h3>
<p><b>Section:</b> 20.2.5 [allocator.requirements] <b>Status:</b> <a href="lwg-active.html#Open">Open</a>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
During the Batavia meeting it turned out that there is a definition
hole for types satisfying the <tt>Allocators</tt> requirements: The problem
became obvious when it was discussed whether all <tt>swap</tt> functions 
of <tt>Containers</tt> with internal data handles can be safely tagged
with <tt>noexcept</tt> or not. While it is correct that the implicit
<tt>swap</tt> function of an allocator is required to be a no-throw
operation (because move/copy-constructors and assignment operators are
required to be no-throw functions), there are no such requirements
for specialized <tt>swap</tt> overloads for a particular allocator.
<p/>
But this requirement is essential because the <tt>Containers</tt> are
required to support <i>swappable</i> <tt>Allocators</tt>, when the value
<tt>allocator_traits&lt;&gt;::propagate_on_container_swap</tt> evaluates
to <tt>true</tt>.
</p>
<p><i>[2011-02-10 Alberto, Daniel, and Pablo collaborated on the proposed wording]</i></p>

<p>
The proposed resolution (based on N3225) attempts to solve the following problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Table 44 &mdash; Allocator requirements, expression rows 
<tt>X::propagate_on_container_copy_assignment</tt>, <tt>X::propagate_on_container_move_assignment</tt>, and
<tt>X::propagate_on_container_swap</tt> only describe operations, but no requirements. In fact, if and only
if these compile-time predicates evaluate to <tt>true</tt>, the <em>additional</em> requirements
<tt>CopyAssignable</tt>,  no-throw <tt>MoveAssignable</tt>, and no-throw lvalue <tt>Swappable</tt>, 
respectively, are imposed on the allocator types.</li>
<li>23.2.1 [container.requirements.general] p. 9 misses to refer to the correct swap conditions: The current wording does not relate to
20.2.2 [swappable.requirements] as it should and omits to mention that lvalues shall be swapped. Additional there is one
situation described twice in p. 8 and p. 9 (undefined behaviour unless <tt>a.get_allocator() == b.get_allocator()</tt>
or <tt>allocator_traits&lt;allocator_type&gt;::propagate_on_container_swap::value == true</tt>), which should be cleaned up.</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Following 20.2.5 [allocator.requirements] p. 3 insert a new normative paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<ins>Note B: If <tt>X::propagate_on_container_copy_assignment::value</tt> is true, <tt>X</tt> shall 
satisfy the <tt>CopyAssignable</tt> requirements (Table 39  [copyassignable]). 
If <tt>X::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value</tt> is true, <tt>X</tt> shall satisfy the 
<tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements (Table 38  [moveassignable]) and the move operation
shall not throw exceptions. If <tt>X::propagate_on_container_swap::value</tt> is true, lvalues of 
<tt>X</tt> shall be swappable (20.2.2 [swappable.requirements]) and the <tt>swap</tt> operation 
shall not throw exceptions.</ins>
</p></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>Modify 23.2.1 [container.requirements.general] p. 8 and p. 9 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
8 - [..] The allocator may be replaced only via assignment or <tt>swap()</tt>. Allocator replacement is 
performed by copy assignment, move assignment, or swapping of the allocator only if 
<tt>allocator_traits&lt;allocator_type&gt;::propagate_on_container_copy_assignment::value</tt>,

container types defined in this Clause, the member <tt>get_allocator()</tt> returns a copy of the allocator 
used to construct the container or, if that allocator has been replaced, a copy of the most recent replacement.
<p/>
9 - The expression <tt>a.swap(b)</tt>, for containers <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> of a standard container type 
other than <tt>array</tt>, shall exchange the values of <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> without invoking any move,

<p>28.7 [re.traits] p. 12 says:</p>

<blockquote><p>
returns true if <tt>f</tt> bitwise or&#39;ed with the result of calling
<tt>lookup_classname</tt> with an iterator pair that designates the character
sequence &quot;w&quot; is not equal to <tt>0</tt> and <tt>c == '_'</tt>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
If the bitmask value corresponding to &quot;w&quot; has a non-zero value (which
it must do) then the bitwise or with any value is also non-zero, and
so <tt>isctype('_', f)</tt> returns true for any <tt>f</tt>. Obviously this is wrong,
since <tt>'_'</tt> is not in every <tt>ctype</tt> category.
</p>

<p>
There&#39;s a similar problem with the following phrases discussing the
&quot;blank&quot; char class.
</p>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>Replace the Returns clause with a description in terms of <tt>ctype</tt>
categories, rather than pseudocode in terms of bitwise operations.

<h3><a name="2021"></a>2021. Further incorrect usages of <tt>result_of</tt></h3>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Issue <a href="lwg-active.html#2017">2017</a> points out some incorrect usages of <tt>result_of</tt> in the
declaration of the function call operator overload of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt>,
but there are more such specification defects:
</p>
<ol>
<li>According to 20.8.10.1.2 [func.bind.bind] p. 3: 
<blockquote><p>
[..] The effect of <tt>g(u1, u2, ..., uM)</tt> shall be <tt>INVOKE(fd, v1, v2, ..., vN, result_of&lt;FD cv (V1, V2, ..., VN)&gt;::type)</tt> [..]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
but <tt>fd</tt> is defined as &quot;an lvalue of type <tt>FD</tt> constructed from <tt>std::forward&lt;F&gt;(f)</tt>&quot;. This means that
the above usage must refer to <tt>result_of&lt;FD cv <strong>&amp;</strong> (V1, V2, ..., VN)&gt;</tt> instead.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Similar in 20.8.10.1.2 [func.bind.bind] p. 10 bullet 2 we have:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
if the value of <tt>is_bind_expression&lt;TiD&gt;::value</tt> is true, the argument is <tt>tid(std::forward&lt;Uj&gt;(uj)...)</tt>
and its type <tt>Vi</tt> is <tt>result_of&lt;TiD cv (Uj...)&gt;::type</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Again, <tt>tid</tt> is defined as &quot;lvalue of type <tt>TiD</tt> constructed from <tt>std::forward&lt;Ti&gt;(ti)</tt>&quot;. This means that
the above usage must refer to <tt>result_of&lt;TiD cv <strong>&amp;</strong> (Uj...)&gt;</tt> instead. We also have similar defect as in
<a href="lwg-active.html#2017">2017</a> in regard to the argument types, this leads us to the further corrected form 
<tt>result_of&lt;TiD cv <strong>&amp;</strong> (Uj<strong>&amp;&amp;</strong>...)&gt;</tt>. This is not the end: Since the <tt>Vi</tt>
are similar sensitive to the argument problem, the last part must say: 
<p/>
&quot;[..] its type <tt>Vi</tt> is <tt>result_of&lt;TiD cv <strong>&amp;</strong> (Uj<strong>&amp;&amp;</strong>...)&gt;::type <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong>&quot;</tt>
<p/>
(The bound arguments <tt>Vi</tt> can never be <tt>void</tt> types, therefore we don't need 
to use the more defensive <tt>std::add_rvalue_reference</tt> type trait)
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The function template <tt>async</tt> is declared as follows (the other overload has the same problem):</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class F, class... Args&gt;
future&lt;typename result_of&lt;F(Args...)&gt;::type&gt;
async(F&amp;&amp; f, Args&amp;&amp;... args);
</pre></blockquote><p>
This usage has the some same problems as we have found in <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> (<a href="lwg-active.html#2017">2017</a>) and more: According to
the specification in 30.6.9 [futures.async] the effective result type is that of the call of
</p><blockquote><pre>
INVOKE(decay_copy(std::forward&lt;F&gt;(f)), decay_copy(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args))...)
</pre></blockquote><p>
First, <tt>decay_copy</tt> potentially modifies the effective types to <tt>decay&lt;F&gt;::type</tt> and <tt>decay&lt;Args&gt;::type...</tt>.
Second, the current specification is not really clear, what the value category of callable type or the arguments shall be: According
to the second bullet of 30.6.9 [futures.async] p. 3:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Invocation of the deferred function evaluates <tt>INVOKE(g, xyz)</tt> where <tt>g</tt> is the stored value of 
<tt>decay_copy(std::forward&lt;F&gt;(f))</tt> and <tt>xyz</tt> is the stored copy of 
<tt>decay_copy(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args))...</tt>.
</p></blockquote><p>
This seems to imply that lvalues are provided in contrast to the direct call expression of 30.6.9 [futures.async] p. 2
which implies rvalues instead. The specification needs to be clarified.
</p>
</li>
</ol>


<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
The suggested wording changes are against the working draft N3225.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Change 20.8.10.1.2 [func.bind.bind] p. 3 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Returns</i>: A forwarding call wrapper <tt>g</tt> with a weak result type (20.8.2). The effect of

where <i>cv</i> represents the <i>cv</i>-qualifiers of <tt>g</tt> and the values and types of the bound arguments 
<tt>v1, v2, ..., vN</tt> are determined as specified below. [..]
</p></blockquote>

</li>

<li>
<p>Change 20.8.10.1.2 [func.bind.bind] p. 10 bullet 2 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>

<p>
Tom Plum pointed out to me that there's an apparent inconsistency in the <tt>std::</tt> qualification of template names in the unordered containers:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
 template &lt;class Key,
           class T,
           class Hash = hash&lt;Key&gt;,
           class Pred = std::equal_to&lt;Key&gt;,
           class Alloc = std::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;const Key, T&gt; &gt; &gt;
   class unordered_map;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Is there a reason that hash is not qualified with <tt>std::</tt>? TR1 also
does not use <tt>std::</tt> here.
</p>

<p><i>[
2011-02-07 Chris Jefferson adds:

<p>
I assumed (I might be wrong) it is because <tt>hash</tt> is designed to be a
customisation point, like <tt>swap</tt>.
</p>

<p><i>[
2011-02-07 Howard Hinnant adds:
]</i></p>

<p>I think this is incorrect.  We mean <tt>std::hash</tt>, though clients
are free to specialize <tt>std::hash</tt> on user-defined types.  With the
possible exception of <tt>begin</tt>/<tt>end</tt> (which I'm not sure if
we've settled that), <tt>swap</tt> is the only intended customization point (look up a function by ADL) in the <tt>std::</tt> lib.

<p>
Related with LWG issue <a href="lwg-active.html#1514">1514</a>.
</p>

<p>
The move constructor of <tt>packaged_task</tt> does not specify how the stored task is constructed. 
The obvious way is to move-construct it using the task stored in the argument. Moreover, the 
constructor should be provided with a throws clause similar to one used for the other constructors, 
as the move constructor of the stored task is not required to be nothrow.</p>

<p>
As for the other constructors, the terms "stores a copy of <tt>f</tt>" do not reflect the intent, which is 
to allow <tt>f</tt> to be moved when possible.
</p>



<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>(wording written assuming LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#1514">1514</a> is also accepted)</p>

<h3><a name="2028"></a>2028. <tt>messages_base::catalog</tt> overspecified</h3>
<p><b>Section:</b> 22.4.7.1 [locale.messages] <b>Status:</b> <a href="lwg-active.html#New">New</a>

<p><b>View all issues with</b> <a href="lwg-status.html#New">New</a> status.</p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In 22.4.7.1 [locale.messages], <tt>messages_base::catalog</tt> is specified to be a typedef to <tt>int</tt>.  
This type is subsequently used to open, access and close catalogs.
</p>

<p>
However, an OS may have catalog/messaging services that are indexed and managed by types other than <tt>int</tt>.  
For example <tt>POSIX</tt>, publishes the <a href="http://www.unix.org/single_unix_specification/">following messaging API</a>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
typedef <em>unspecified</em> nl_catd;

nl_catd catopen(const char* name , int oflag);
char*   catgets(nl_catd catd, int set_id, int msg_id, const char* s);
int     catclose(nl_catd catd);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
I.e., the catalog is managed with an unspecified type, not necessarily an <tt>int</tt>.  
Mac OS uses a <tt>void*</tt> for <tt>nl_catd</tt> (which is conforming to the <tt>POSIX</tt> standard).  
The current <tt>messages_base</tt> spec effectively outlaws using the built-in OS messaging service 
supplied for this very purpose!
</p>

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Clause 30.6.9 [futures.async] has undergone significant rewording
in Batavia. Due to co-presence of at least three different sources
of modification there is a part where changes have overlapped
(marked by an Editor's note), which should be reconciled. Moreover,
I believe that a few non-overlapping sentences are now incorrect
and should be fixed, so the problem cannot be handled editorially.
(See c++std-lib-29667.)

<p>
An <dfn>asynchronous return object</dfn>

A <dfn>waiting function</dfn> of an asynchronous return object
is one that potentially blocks

<ins>If a waiting function can return
